# LoRa-Gateway-Logger
A logging service application that tracks network health for an IoT gateway
---

# Getting Started
1. Rasperry Pi/ Virtual IoT device (CounterFit)
2: Visual Studio Code
3. Python 3.0^

##IoT device
An IoT device is ideal for this project to mimic real-world performance of the logger and interact with sensors and actuators. Two options are available:
    • On Raspberry Pi, boot the device as usual and code directly on the Python IDE to create the script
    • On simulation, install CounterFit as described in this article (Hello World - CounterFit)[].
The Python virtual environment creates an isolated instance of an IoT device in your chosen folder

2. ##Visual Studio Code
Install Visual Studio Code from Microsoft Store or the applications official page. VS Code comes with a built-in terminal for quick development. I highly recommend a **Git Bash** terminal for easy shell scripting, which can be made default for your VS Code by selecting settings in the terminal window.

3. ##Python 
Python 3.0 and above provides support for more modern functionality for this service.
